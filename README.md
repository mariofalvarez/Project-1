# Project-1

Welcome to our event app.

Group: Mario Alvarez, Jimmy Nguyen, Herman Liu, Sarah Naas.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery, Firebase (live database), moment JS, TicketMaster API,
Weatherbit API, Github.

Our project allows you to search through a list of events provided by the ticket master API and add them to a list of saved events. These events are stored to firebase, so the user can see events that they have previously saved.
The search will also show you the weather in the city you've searched.
